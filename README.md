# Day_Planner_9-5

## A work day scheduler

This project provides the user with a planner that is interactive for the hours 0900 - 1700. Please refer to the points below for project-build aspects and functionality.

### Project-build aspects

The following was used to build the code for this day planner:

1. HTML and CSS *see **Credit** section*
2. Bootstrap used to build main section for DOM manipulation as commented in `index.html`
3. Moment.js used in `script.js` to present and manipulate time within DOM and JavaScript
3. JQuery used for DOM manipulation in `script.js`

### Functionality

The following lists all functions within the project:

* current **date** and **time** displayed above timer
    * *not **live**/**dynamic** due to moment.js not set within setInterval function*
* each time-block is color-coded to reflect "past" = grey, "present" = red, "future" = green
* an area within each time-block to enter entries for activities or to-do's
* save button will store entries to localStorage
* entries will be saved when planner is refreshed
* entries can be cleared with the **"Clear all entries!"** button below date/time stamp
* alert windows to give users a response to user-interactive functions

### Process

Writing pseudo-code provides logical steps in breaking down a bigger problem into each
individual blocks. Please refer to the comments retained in the `script.js` file.
